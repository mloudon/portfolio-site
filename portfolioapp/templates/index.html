Hello! I'm Melissa and this is my site. I'm a <a href="http://annenberg.usc.edu/Faculty/Doctoral%20Students/Loudon_Melissa.aspx">
PhD student</a> at 
<a href="http://annenberg.usc.edu/">USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism</a>, although I'm at the point where I'm not on campus all that often. 
I also do occasional consulting and I build things, mostly with Python.</p>
<p>
My dissertation is about mobile apps and services for development, specifically in South Africa.
</p>
<p>
Before, I worked at the <a href="www.uct.ac.za">University of Cape Town</a> in what is now the <a href="http://www.icomms.org/">iComms research group</a>, did an MSc in ICTs for Development
at the <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>, worked at <a href="www.cell-life.org">Cell-Life</a> on the <a href="http://www.cell-life.org/systems/dispense-idart/">iDart open source pharmacy management system</a>, and, way back before Google Earth was a thing,
did an undergraduate degree in Geoinformatics and Computer Science at the University of Cape Town.  
</p>
<p>
Things will be appearing here periodically. 
In this issue: writing (academic), writing (code), Linux, Python/Django, mobile security, GIS, network analysis in R,
and that sweet little <strike>Latitude Public Location Widget</strike> homebrew location tracker that hopefully stops just short of fulfilling your stalk-y desires.
</p>
